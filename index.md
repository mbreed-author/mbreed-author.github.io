*The Hammond Conjecture* is an alternative-history novel which explores themes of memory, identity and historical narrative. It is also a lot of fun.

Are you sure you know who you are? If your memories disappeared and were replaced with someone else’s, would you still be you? And what if those memories were not just from another person - but of a different world?

London 1982 – perhaps. Regaining consciousness in an isolation ward of catatonic patients, glimpsing the outside world only through a television news bulletin, that is the dilemma facing Hugh Hammond.

Gradually Hugh’s memories return – of his life as an MI6 officer a decade earlier. But in a world where Britain has been locked in a lonely Cold War against a Fascist-dominated Europe. Are his memories false: delusions, or implanted as part of a mind-control experiment? Or was the television news fake – and if so, why? And what is the role of Carlton, the shadowy Intelligence officer who delivered him to the hospital?

Hugh types out his recollections: an adventure which takes him from an opium den in Limehouse, via a hippie encampment in British-occupied North France, to a State Reception for the Deputy Führer in the Durbar Court in Whitehall, and a Le Carre-style climax in the divided city of Paris.

Meanwhile in the hospital Hugh struggles to understand his predicament, and to escape from it. But escape only leads him into greater danger.

*Very well thought-out. Reminds me of Michael Moorcock’s earlier novels.* – Gary Gibson, leading British sci-fi writer.

*The Events of 1968* is set in Hugh Hammond's alternative world in the year before he returned to Britain. It follows the coming-of-age of his younger brother Thomas from shy, insecure and sexually confused schoolboy to a centred young man who has learned the difference between sex and love, and who is prepared to fight for whom, rather than what, he believes in.

Sixteen-year-old Tommy doesn’t question his sheltered, repressed life until he meets Iona at the school disco. She introduces him to a world of Left Bank intellectuals and left-wing philosophers. When King Edward VIII appoints a populist kleptocrat as PM they become politically active, organising a schoolkids trade union. But as parliamentary democracy collapses and fascists and anarchists run wild, their relationship also hits the rocks. Iona is sucked into Maoist fervour while Tommy takes an LSD trip at university which reveals his childhood trauma.

After an Army coup, student activists stage a doomed sit-in in Trafalgar Square. A massacre is threatened: does Iona survive? Will Tommy find her? Will she renounce activism and return to him? Does he really want her to?

The story picks up from where the parallel timelines in *The Hammond Conjecture* ended:

It is 1984. Major Carlton is running a maverick Military Intelligence investigation aiming to prove that Europe faces an interdimensional invasion by a nuclear-armed Third Reich from a parallel world. He is unaware that the powers-that-be have decided to close down this ludicrous operation, and to eliminate its star witness, who claims to have himself been transmitted from the other world.

Meanwhile it is 1973 in an almost identical parallel universe of which we know nothing. A fugitive MI6 officer who has been hiding out in Algiers, is tracked down and abducted by his erstwhile colleagues. He is to be sent on a perilous mission into the heart of the Third Reich, where in a secret institute a team of quantum physicists are thought to be developing a form of teleportation, which would be used to further the Führer’s dream of world domination. His task is to disrupt their activities.

Only these two men can foil the Führer’s dream of multi-world domination and prevent catastrophe. Unfortunately both of them are Hugh Hammond.
