<br/>

*The Hammond Conjecture* is an alternative-history novel which explores themes of memory, identity and historical narrative. It is also a lot of fun.

Are you sure you know who you are? If your memories disappeared and were replaced with someone else’s, would you still be you? And what if those memories were not just from another person - but of a different world?

London 1982 – perhaps. Regaining consciousness in an isolation ward of catatonic patients, glimpsing the outside world only through a television news bulletin, that is the dilemma facing Hugh Hammond.

Gradually Hugh’s memories return – of his life as an MI6 officer a decade earlier. But in a world where Britain has been locked in a lonely Cold War against a Fascist-dominated Europe. Are his memories false: delusions, or implanted as part of a mind-control experiment? Or was the television news fake – and if so, why? 

<!---“Very well thought-out … Reminds me of Michael Moorcock’s earlier novels.” – Gary Gibson, leading British sci-fi writer.--->

![The Events of 1968: An Alternative History](/assets/img/events-uea-cover.png){:class="large-img"}

<br/>

The novel is set in 1968, in a Britain which had signed a peace treaty with Hitler in 1941. It follows the development of the young Thomas Hammond from shy, insecure and sexually confused schoolboy to a centred young man who has learned the difference between sex and love, and who is prepared to fight for whom, rather than what, he believes in.

Sixteen-year-old Tommy doesn’t question his sheltered, repressed life until he meets Iona at the school disco. She introduces him to a world of Left Bank intellectuals and left-wing philosophers. When King Edward VIII appoints a populist kleptocrat as PM they become politically active, organising a schoolkids’ trade union. But as parliamentary democracy collapses and fascists and anarchists run wild, their relationship also hits the rocks. Iona is sucked into Maoist fervour while Tommy takes an LSD trip at university which reveals his childhood trauma.

After an Army coup, student activists stage a doomed sit-in in Trafalgar Square. A massacre is threatened: does Iona survive? Will Tommy find her? Will she renounce activism and return to him? Does he really want her to?
