I submitted it to 8 agents, researched from the WAY. No response at all from most of them. Two sent personal responses. The major agent for sci-fi novels wrote that _"I can see the imagination and intelligence at work here, but I canâ€™t honestly say I loved it. The entry level for a new novelist now is 'special', not 'good'."_

Perhaps self-publishing is the way to go...
