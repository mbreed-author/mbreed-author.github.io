## Chapter 5: Swimbridge

1. **Frontotemporal dementia**: A relatively rare form of dementia. Hugh's mother has behavioural variant FTD. The [symptoms](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/frontotemporal-dementia-symptoms) include loss of inhibitions, apathy, loss of empathy, and compulsive ritualised behaviour.

2. **All the right words**: A reference to the [Morecambe and Wise sketch featuring Andre Previn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMPEUcVyJsc) in their 1971 Christmas Special show. When Previn complained that Eric was playing all the wrong notes, he replied that he was playing "all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order."

3. **That Maharishi**: The [Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maharishi-mahesh-yogi-india-guru-the-beatles-meditation-a8543666.html) was the Beatles' spiritual advisor, who introduced the world to transcendental meditation. 
 
4. **The BDM**: The Bund Deutscher Maedel (League of German Girls) was the female wing of the Hitler Youth (HJ) in Nazi Germany. Artur Axmann had overall control of both organisations in his role as Reich Youth Leader (Reichsjugendfuehrer).

5. **British Expeditionary Force**: [The untold story of the BEF](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/80/a4300480.shtml) is an article in the BBC's WW2 People's War project, featuring personal testimony. 

6. The **Danzig Corridor**: see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Corridor). The Corridor provided Poland with access to the sea at the (mostly German-speaking) port of Danzig, now Gdansk. In the process it separated East Prussia from the rest of the German Reich. 
An [article](http://www.interpretermag.com/lithuania-could-become-putins-danzig-corridor-portnikov-says/) in 2014 suggests that Putin may demand a corridor across Lithuania to secure land communication with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad (formerly Koenigsberg, the capital of East Prussia, which was seized by Stalin at the end of WW2). 

7. **“Hatley Castle”**: The castle, built in Victoria, British Columbia in 1910, was visited by King George VI in 1941, who [considered it as a place of exile](https://househistree.com/houses/hatley-castle) for his brother the Duke of Windsor who had been sent to the Bahamas as Governor after his abdication.

8. **SDS**: the [Special Demonstration Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Demonstration_Squad) was an undercover unit of the Metropolitan Police, set up in 1968 to infiltrate left-wing protest groups. It used the names of 80 dead children to create flase identities for its members, who were nicknamed 'hairies' because they dressed as hippies to go undercover. Some of them started sexual relationships with protest organisers in order to gain their trust.
