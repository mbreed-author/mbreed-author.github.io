## Chapter 5: Insemination  


1. In our world it was in 1974 that the Conservative Party (under Edward Heath) narrowly lost the general election, resulting in **a hung Parliament**.

4. The description of a **dismal pre-1968 Britain** uses my own memories. I was told that in Northern Ireland, Council workers used to chain up the swings in the playground on a Sunday to satisfy the Protestant churches. I heard the anecdote about the Mount Snowdon Railway on the Terry Wogan Show on BBC radio.

5. **Benares** was the old name for modern'day Varanasi.

6. **The University of East Anglia** was one of the new universities created by Harold Wilson's government - called plate-glass as distinct from the old red-brick ones. The University Plain was built from scratch in a river valley outside Norwich, as a massive concrete Teaching Wall across the valley, with the Schools connected by walkways. The different Schools were known by TLAs (three-letter acronyms): MAP, EUR, SOC, etc. The student accommodation was in the Ziggurats, five-storey semi-pyramids. In my first year I lived at Pipers Lane, a former RAF base, but in my final year I was in a ziggurat. If you see [the final episode 13 of the Kenneth Clark BBC TV series Civilisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK6UpqNctkQ), 40 minutes in, it shows UEA as the brave new world of the future, making student life look like a Club Mediterranee - which it was.
Here's [an aerial view of the Plain in 1968](http://www.acoombe.co.uk/UEA/).

7. I know about the **38th July Movement** at UEA because I and a group of friends invented it.

7. **UCCA** has now become UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service). 

8. Check out Tariq Ali and Bertrand Russell on Wikipedia. The chant **Jo - Jo - Jomo K!** refers to Jomo Kenyatta, who fought for Kenyan independence. In my day we chanted Ho - Ho - Ho Chi Minh!


## Chapter 6: Exhilaration

1. King Edward VIII had some shady friends. **Baron Granville** resembles [Kenneth de Courcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_de_Courcy) who worked to get Edward restored to the throne. In 1964 he was jailed for seven years for fraud. But at least Edward didn't mirror our current [Royal Family's association with paedophiles](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/right-royal-paedophilia).

2. The **glider flight** was the best and most memorable experience of my school life.


## Chapter 7: Information

1. **Baron Granville's speech** in Downing St was copied in our own world by [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhXlAGmUitU) when she entered No 10 in 1979.

2. **Horst Wessel** was a Berlin Sturmführer of the Sturmabteilung, the Nazi Party's stormtroopers. After his killing in 1930, he was made into a martyr for the Nazi cause by Joseph Goebbels. (Wikipedia)


## Chapter 8: Conversation

1. **Little Lord Fauntleroy:** A person who is spoiled, conceited, and characterized by a pompous air of decadence, intellectualism, and moral superiority. (thefreedictionary.com)  

2. The **Walking Buddha** in the British Museum is pictured [here](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1947-0514-1). 


## Chapter 9: Unionisation

1. The **Schools Democracy Union** is based on the [Schools Action Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_Action_Union), formed in 1969. It organised a national school strike in 1972. It soon became dominated by Maoists.

2. **Arthur Scargill** led an [unofficial miners strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_(1969)) in 1969.

3. The **International Socialists** became the [Socialist Workers Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Workers_Party_(UK)) in 1977.


## Chapter 10: Intimidation

1. The [**Paedophile Information Exchange**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophile_Information_Exchange) was a British pro-paedophile activist group, founded in October 1974 and officially disbanded in 1984. It was indeed [affiliated to the National Council for Civil Liberties](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/26/lobbying-paedophile-campaign-revealed-hewitt) now known as Liberty. Its members hotline was answered from within the Home Office, and it is alleged to have received Government funding.
