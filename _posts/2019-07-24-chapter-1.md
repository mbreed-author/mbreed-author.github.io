1. The passage _“The anamnestic powers of L-Dopa…”_ quoted by Dr Jones is in footnote 136 of _Awakenings_ by Oliver Sacks (see notes to Hospital diary 2). 

2. The patient nicknamed Pelé is based on patients with this ability described in footnote 14 of _Awakenings_, in particular one at Highlands Hospital who was nicknamed Puskas after a famous footballer of the time.
