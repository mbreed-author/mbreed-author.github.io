There has been a spate of reports in local newspapers, all with a similar strange story. Typically, someone has been lost in tragic or violent circumstances, presumed dead. But a few days later he reappears, quite unharmed. Now, in a *WotW* exclusive, one man has agreed to tell his story, asking only for anonymity and a five-figure fee. He had disappeared in a snowstorm while climbing in the Cairngorms, but on the third day he descended again. This is his story:

Hours after my fatal fall, I had the near-death experience you hear about: the agonising pain and hypothermia faded, and I floated upward, away from my body. Then I felt myself sucked through a dark tunnel, faster and faster, towards a point of bright light, which grew and grew until I emerged into a vast park: green lawns and flowerbeds, dotted with gleaming glasshouses lit within by an ethereal glow. At first I thought I was in Kew Gardens, but the streams were flowing with milk and honey, there was a giant chocolate fountain, and no litter. 

Signposts pointed along different paths to the glass pavilions. The biggest ones were in Arabic and Hebrew, but I eventually found a small faded sign saying **Heaven (C of E)**, with a flag of St George in the bottom right corner. The path led me to a rather scruffy glasshouse, its panes dirty and some of them broken, but I knew that this was the Anglican heaven because of the pearly gates at the entrance. Though, coming closer, I saw they were actually of pearl-effect melamine, rather cheap and tacky. There was no-one around. I pushed on the gates but they were locked. Then I noticed an answerphone on the wall; I pressed the button and it crackled into life.

After giving my full name and date of death, and answering a series of security questions, I heard a recorded announcement: 
*Welcome to the Gates of Heaven (Church of England). Your visit is important to us. However we are currently experiencing higher than usual call volumes; please wait and a member of St Peter Reception Team will be with you shortly.*
