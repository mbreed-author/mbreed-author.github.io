A *Way of the World* investigation has uncovered a spate of reports in local newspapers, all with a similar strange story. Typically, someone has been lost in tragic or violent circumstances, presumed dead. But a few days later he reappears, quite unharmed, though he refuses to discuss what happened to him. But now, in a WotW exclusive, one man, a cultural historian by profession, has agreed to tell his story, asking only for anonymity and a five-figure fee. He had disappeared in a snowstorm while climbing in the Cairngorms, but on the third day he descended again.
