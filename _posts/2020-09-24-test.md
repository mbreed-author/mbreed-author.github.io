A test blog post

Hello,

The Pentacle Papers newsletter - September 2020

Hello,

Thank you for opening this latest newsletter, which is a sounding-board for my writings, principally my novel The Hammond Conjecture. If you havent yet done so, please 

A delayed and brief newsletter this time, as Ive been spending the days enjoying the last gasp of summer here. Now the weather has turned cold and damp, and we are heading for another lockdown, so the next newsletter should be meatier.
