It's been a steep learning curve, discovering how to use canva, draft2digital, bookfunnel, hostinger and campayn, but I've finally produced a marketing campaign for my yet-to-be-published novel _The Hammond Conjecture_. It should be out in the summer. Please click on the link on the main page, to get your free download of the first six chapters.  

It would be great if you commented on this blog, with your review of it. And, if you like what you read, please tell your friends about it!
