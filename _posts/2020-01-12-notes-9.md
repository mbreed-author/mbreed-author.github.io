## Chapter 9: Easter

1. **Lebensborn, Ahnenerbe**: The Lebensborn (Fount of Life) organisation was set up by the SS to increase the birth rate of racially-pure Aryan children. The Ahnenerbe (Ancestral Heritage) was an SS research organisation dedicated to proving the superiority of the Aryan races. 

2. **Abbazia**: A spa town on the Istrian peninsula, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it was assigned to Italy after WW1. After WW2 it passed to the new Yugoslavia, and is today known as Opatija.  

3. **The 1933 photograph is at [rebeccastarrbrown.com](https://rebeccastarrbrown.com/2017/08/25/the-death-of-george-duke-of-kent/)** It shows the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VIII, standing with his brothers Prince Albert Duke of York (who succeeded him as King George VI), Prince Henry Duke of Gloucester and Prince George Duke of Kent. The webpage also describes the mysterious death of Prince George in 1942. The 'largely implausible book' it mentions must be [Double Standards: the Rudolf Hess Cover-up](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Double-Standards-Rudolf-Hess-Cover-Up/dp/0751532207).

5. **The Volkshalle** was to be the largest building in Hitler's and Speer's plan for the postwar German capital. The dome was to be 290 metres high, and with up to 180,000 people inside it is thought that clouds would have formed beneath the roof. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkshalle)    

6. **Gypsy Moth IV**, in which Francis Chichester circumnavigated the globe single-handed in 1967, was put on display at Greenwich, alongside the *Cutty Sark*. It was bought by the Gypsy Moth Trust in 2004 for a price of £1 plus a gin-and-tonic, and restored. It can frequently be seen at Bucklers Hard, and is featured on the inside back cover of British passports. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gipsy_Moth_IV).
