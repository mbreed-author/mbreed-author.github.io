title: Why footnotes for 'The Hammond Conjecture'? 
category: references
---

A big influence when I started writing _The Hammond Conjecture_ was the series of [Flashman novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flashman_Papers) by George McDonald Fraser. In these, the cowardly, lecherous all-round cad Harry Flashman finds himself involved in major historical events of the Victorian era. The facts about many of these events are often so unlikely that the reader will not believe them, so Fraser provides historical footnotes for each chapter at the end of the novel.

There is also a great deal of 'Forbidden History' in my novel, and rather than provide the background info and links within the manuscript, I am putting it up on my website. If you have any corrections or comments, please email me at **martin@mbreed.co.uk** .
