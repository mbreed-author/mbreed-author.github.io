When I discovered my late father's diaries and papers in 2016, I realised that the public deserved to know the suppressed facts about Operation Pentacle. A friend put me in touch with MB Reed. After reading all the documents, he persuaded me that publishers would not be willing to touch it (and it would probably be banned under the Official Secrets Act). Instead, he should present it as a work of fiction. I now wonder if I should have agreed to this. The 'humourous' episodes in the story are MB Reed's invention.
