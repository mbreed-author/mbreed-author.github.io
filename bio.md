I studied mathematics at the University of East Anglia in the late 1960's. Since then, I have taught maths in universities around the world (Germany, Lesotho, Swaziland, Papua New Guinea) before returning to the UK as a lecturer at Brunel University in 1986. In 2005 I joined the Maths Dept of the University of Bath as Director of Teaching. I retired in September 2018.

*The Hammond Conjecture* is my first novel.
